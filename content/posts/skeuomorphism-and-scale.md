We inhabit an era dominated by monotonous digital interfaces. While not literally identical, contemporary software experiences create a sensation of uniformity. Examining historical snapshots from 2005 via the Wayback Machine reveals distinctly differentiated websites with unique visual identities.

In contrast, navigating multiple modern sites feels like traversing identical retail environments with merely different inventory. Why has this shift occurred compared to a decade prior?

I think the answer comes down to two things:

1. An excessive reaction against meaningless skeuomorphism, and
2. A relentless pursuit of scaling at any cost permeating the technology sector.

## The Problem of Decorative Skeuomorphism

To think about design problems clearly, I find it useful to organize things into three buckets: **Culture** (user assumptions), **Element** (enabled activities), and **Form** (display methodology).

Logic Pro's bass adjustment feature exemplifies superior design — the physical slider form naturally emerges from professional audio culture without obscuring functionality.

Pre-iOS 7 Notes applications presented a contrasting example. Header decorations included pixelated torn-paper effects mimicking physical legal pads. While technically accomplished, this ornamental skeuomorphism confused users about actual functionality without clarifying purpose.

By 2012, widespread frustration with decorative iOS elements prompted celebrated pushback. iOS 7's introduction established a decisive pivot: flat design replaced ornamental embellishment, crisp geometry supplanted simulated textures.

This was the right call. The ornamental skeuomorphism was bad. But the pendulum swung too far.

## Scale-at-All-Costs Economics

The 2010s witnessed venture capital saturation driving massive funding rounds and astronomical valuations. This investment thesis inherently pressured companies toward unicorn trajectories, transforming potential lifestyle businesses into growth-obsessed ventures.

This economic reality fundamentally altered software culture assumptions. While iOS 7 successfully reset Element and Form priorities, venture incentives reshaped Culture parameters entirely.

Geographic design preferences vary significantly — Americans favor yellow legal pads, Japanese users prefer distinctive Mnemosyne notebooks, Germans utilize Hahnemühle's Iconic options. Culturally-responsive design typically adapts form according to local preferences while maintaining consistent elements.

Scaling mandates presume North American markets minimum, with ultimate global dominion. Billion-dollar exit requirements demand worldwide addressable markets, flattening diverse cultural contexts into singular mono-cultures. Without distinct cultural inputs, design outputs necessarily converge.

## The Contemporary Result

Design corrections from skeuomorphism combined with universal-audience assumptions produce inevitable consequences: everything appears aesthetically similar despite functional differences. Websites share restricted color palettes deemed universally acceptable. Functionally dissimilar applications feel interchangeable. Extended platform usage confirms this homogenization.

This convergence creates widespread design boredom.

## Notable Counterexamples

Exceptions exist — Playdate and Orion demonstrate technological applications embracing distinctive charm. Presumably, these creators avoid pursuing billion-dollar valuations.

This pattern suggests future innovation emerges from teams unconcerned with universal popularity, willing to embrace opinionated decisions that alienate certain audiences, operating within specialized market segments. Those seeking compelling design should explore niche-vertical teams deliberately disregarding mass-market aspirations.
