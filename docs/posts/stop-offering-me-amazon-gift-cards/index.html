        <p>I recently started a new role. Evidently, part of the initiation is receiving a flood of unsolicited emails from SaaS companies looking to sell me their latest-and-greatest. To my surprise, it&#39;s now the norm to offer to pay me personally &quot;just to hop on the phone&quot;. I&#39;ve received multiple emails from companies (the two that I was able to find quickly in my inbox were from Galactic Fed and Premier Soft) telling me why I should sign my employer up for their services. They then promise that if I get on the phone with them they&#39;ll send me a $50-100 Amazon gift card.</p>
<p>My response to them is also the point of this blog post:</p>
<p><em>&quot;It&#39;s unethical to offer to pay me personally as a way to influence purchasing decisions on behalf of my employer. Do better.&quot;</em></p>
<p>There are three problems with this approach to sales:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It&#39;s unethical.</strong> This seems to be the low-stakes SaaS version of pharmaceutical reps paying for doctors to go on vacation. But ethics aren&#39;t dependent on how life saving something is. Regardless of the stakes, it&#39;s unethical to pay someone privately while they&#39;re representing their employer or are being trusted to be impartial. Even if it&#39;s as small as $50, it&#39;s a conflict of interest.</li>
<li><strong>It will blow up on you.</strong> If you have someone accept it and then their employer finds out, good luck closing that deal!</li>
<li><strong>It makes you look bad.</strong> If I&#39;ve never heard of you before, my first impression is that you are desperate. It&#39;s a bad look.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;ll admit, there are some grey areas. For example, if you&#39;re sending this to someone that owns the company outright then there wouldn&#39;t be an inherent conflict of interest. But, by and large, this is ethically wrong and everyone should stop doing this.</p>
<p>While we&#39;re here, also feel free to stop cold pitching me. That&#39;s not ethics advice, that&#39;s just a plea to save my inbox.</p>
<p><strong>Updated List</strong> (companies that sent these offers):</p>
<ul>
<li>Galactic Fed, 07/12/24</li>
<li>Premier Soft, 07/17/24</li>
<li>NetSpring, 09/10/24</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Footnotes: Gift cards as an incentive aren&#39;t always bad — it&#39;s when they&#39;re confusing your personal vs. professional roles. For example, a gift card for a personal G2 review or research initiative has no conflict.</em></p>
